/*
 * This program will simulate a withdrawal from a bank account.
 * It does the following:
 *   - Prompt the customer for the current balance
 *     (and convert to float).
 *   - Prompt the customer for the amount to withdraw
 *     (and convert to float).
 *   - If the amount is less than or equal to the balance:
 *       - subtract the amount from the balance
 *       - print the updated balance
 *   - Otherwise:
 *       - tell the customer they can't withdraw more than
 *         their balance.
 *   - Print a "Thank you for banking with us" message
